## What it is
A small wrapper utility around dd to create bootable usb-s fast and easy - written in python.

## What it does
- Looks through your home directory and lists your ISO files (newest first) to choose one
- Downloads iso's from the internet if you have none available in your current directory
- Lists your connected USB drives (by their brand and size for easy recognition) to choose one
- Unmount your selected USB if it's mounted
- Puts your selected ISO on it (with the *dd* utility)

## What it needs
- Python 3
- A system that has the following utilities installed: *find*, *mount*, and *dd*

## Why would you need it
I'm the type of user how likes experimenting with different OS-s and distros and found it way too time consuming to manually create the bootable usb-s in the command line. I hope others find this useful as well.

**disclaimer:** This program is just a wrapper around existing utilities and
nothing more, it won't do anything else other than speeding up the tedious
process of using *dd*.

## How to install it
```
pip install bootable-usb
```
## How to use it
Just run the following command and after that everything should be self-explanatory
```
bootable-usb
```
